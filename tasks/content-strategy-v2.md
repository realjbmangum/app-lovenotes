# SendMyLove v2 — Content Strategy

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Couples Apps)

| App | Price | What It Does | Downloads/Users | Key Weakness |
|-----|-------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Paired** | Free + Premium (est. ~$70/yr) | Daily questions, courses, quizzes for couples | 8M downloads, ~$200k/mo revenue | BOTH partners need the app. It's homework. Men don't download couples apps. |
| **Lasting** | $29.99/mo or $89.99/6mo | Self-guided couples therapy. Modules on communication, intimacy. Therapist workshops. | Unknown | Expensive. Therapy-framed = feels like admitting something's wrong. NOT actual therapy. |
| **Lovewick** | Free + Plus ($29.99/yr) | 1000+ couple questions, date ideas, journaling, "forget-me-not" notes | 350k+ couples | Feature-bloated. Still requires both partners. Questions aren't actionable. |
| **Agape** | £47.99/yr for 2 | Daily personalized question to spark conversation in 1 min | Unknown | Both partners needed. Just questions, no help with DOING anything about it. |
| **Flamme** | ~$40/yr | AI coaching, drawing games, gamified daily connection | Unknown | Gamification feels juvenile for older married couples. Both partners needed. |
| **Love Nudge** | Free | Love language quiz + partner linking | Unknown | Shallow. Quiz-based, no ongoing value. |
| **Between** | Free + premium | Private couples messaging, calendar, memories | Unknown | Just a chat app. Doesn't help you know WHAT to say. |

### The Critical Gap Every Competitor Misses

**Every single app requires BOTH partners to participate.**

SendMyLove is the ONLY product that is:
- **For him only** — she doesn't need an account, an app, or to know it exists
- **Action-oriented** — not questions to discuss, but messages to SEND
- **One-sided by design** — he uses it, she just gets better texts from her husband

This is our positioning moat.

### Indirect Competitors

| Alternative | What People Do | Where SendMyLove Wins |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **ChatGPT / AI chatbots** | Ask "write a sweet text for my wife Sarah" | No daily nudge, no relationship memory, no habit loop, requires initiative every time |
| **Google "love messages for wife"** | Copy from listicle sites (GoodHousekeeping, Marriage.com, etc.) | Same generic slop problem — wives detect copy-paste instantly |
| **Pinterest love quote boards** | Browse and screenshot quotes | Zero personalization, cringe aesthetic, not actionable |
| **"52 texts for your wife" blog posts** | Read an article like Brad Hambrick's list | Static list, no guidance on WHEN or HOW, read once and forget |
| **Doing nothing** | Most men just... don't text romantic things | This is our REAL competitor. Inertia. The guy who means to but doesn't. |

### The Real Competitor Is Inertia

The biggest competitor is not an app. It's the guy who thinks "I should text her something nice" at 10am, gets busy, and by 6pm has forgotten. SendMyLove wins by being the nudge that shows up at the right moment WITH a starting point.

## Target Audience

### Primary: "The Well-Meaning Husband"

**Demographics:**
- Male, 28-50
- Married 2-15 years
- Has kids (time-starved)
- Middle class ($50-120k household income)
- Uses iPhone primarily
- Not on TikTok much, but on Reddit, YouTube, Instagram

**Psychographics:**
- Loves his wife but has gotten comfortable
- Knows he SHOULD be more romantic/expressive
- Feels guilty about it sometimes
- Not naturally a "words" person — shows love through acts of service
- Embarrassed to ask for help with this
- Doesn't want to feel fake or performative
- Would never download a "couples app"

### Customer Language (Voice of Customer)

These are the phrases real men use when describing this problem. Use these EXACT phrases in copy:

**Describing the problem:**
- "I'm not good with words"
- "I don't know what to say"
- "I love her, I just can't express it"
- "She says I'm not romantic enough"
- "It's not that I don't feel it, I just don't know how to say it"
- "I want to text her more but I blank out"
- "I don't want to sound cheesy"
- "By the time I think of something, the moment's passed"
- "I show love differently — acts of service, not words"
- "We used to text all day when we were dating. Now it's just logistics."
- "She wants me to be more affectionate over text"

**Objections and hesitations:**
- "She'll know it's not really me"
- "It feels fake"
- "What if she thinks I'm being weird?"
- "Real men don't need help with this"
- "I don't want to use some AI to talk to my wife"
- "Is this cheating? Like, emotionally outsourcing?"

**What wives actually say they want:**
- "I just want to know you're thinking about me during the day"
- "A random text in the middle of the day makes my whole week"
- "It doesn't have to be poetry. Just something real."
- "I miss the texts we used to send when we were dating"
- "It's not about the words, it's that you took 30 seconds to think of me"

### Key Insight for Positioning

The husband doesn't need better words. He needs:
1. **A trigger** — reminder to do it at all
2. **A starting point** — something to react to instead of a blank screen
3. **Confidence** — knowing what he says will land well

SendMyLove provides all three. The message is still HIS.

## Content Pillars (3)

### Pillar 1: "The Art of Texting Your Wife" (Searchable)
**Why:** Massive search demand. Listicle sites dominate with garbage copy-paste messages. We can own this with BETTER content that actually teaches men how to communicate.

**Cluster topics:**
- "What to text your wife during the day" (high volume)
- "Romantic texts for your wife that don't sound fake"
- "Good morning texts for your wife (that she'll actually love)"
- "How to text your wife when you're not good with words"
- "Funny texts to send your wife"
- "Flirty texts for your wife after years of marriage"
- "What to text your wife on your anniversary"
- "Sweet texts for your wife when she's having a bad day"

**Angle:** Don't just list messages. Teach the WHY behind each one. "Here's a text. Here's why it works. Here's how to make it yours."

**Product tie-in:** Every article ends with "Want messages like these personalized for YOUR wife? Try SendMyLove free."

### Pillar 2: "Being a Better Husband (Without Being Perfect)" (Shareable)
**Why:** This is the emotional content that gets shared on Reddit, forwarded between guys, and goes viral on TikTok. It's the brand-builder.

**Cluster topics:**
- "You're not bad at romance. You're out of practice."
- "Why your wife doesn't want poetry — she wants proof"
- "The 30-second habit that saved my marriage" (daily text)
- "What 'I'm not good with words' really means"
- "Your wife doesn't want a love letter. She wants a Tuesday afternoon text."
- "The difference between romantic and thoughtful (and why it matters)"
- "Why men stop texting after marriage"
- "She doesn't need grand gestures. She needs consistent small ones."

**Angle:** Honest, vulnerable, guy-to-guy. Not preachy. Not therapy-speak. Like advice from a friend who figured it out.

**Product tie-in:** Organic — "I built a tool for this because I had the same problem."

### Pillar 3: "Relationship Communication That Actually Works" (Searchable + Shareable)
**Why:** Bridges the gap between our tactical content (Pillar 1) and our emotional content (Pillar 2). Builds authority.

**Cluster topics:**
- "The 5 love languages explained for men who don't read self-help books"
- "Why 'I love you' stops feeling special (and what to say instead)"
- "How to talk about feelings when you're not a 'feelings' person"
- "The texting mistake that makes your wife feel like a roommate"
- "What your wife means when she says 'you never text me anymore'"
- "Acts of service vs. words of affirmation: why you need both"
- "How to be romantic when you're exhausted, busy, and out of ideas"

**Angle:** Practical relationship advice reframed for guys who'd never read a relationship blog. Short, direct, no fluff.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes
- **Buddy, not therapist** — like getting advice from your best friend who's somehow great with women
- **Honest, not preachy** — we don't lecture. We relate. "Yeah, this is hard. Here's what works."
- **Funny, not corny** — self-deprecating humor about being a typical dude. Never "hubby" or "wifey."
- **Specific, not vague** — real examples, not motivational poster language
- **Confident, not apologetic** — don't hedge. "This works" not "this might help"

### Words We Use
- "Text her" (not "send her a message")
- "Real" / "genuine" / "yours"
- "Blank out" / "freeze up" / "brain goes empty"
- "She'll love this" / "this one lands"
- "Your words, not ours"
- "Fill in the blank"
- "The nudge you need"

### Words We NEVER Use
- "AI-powered" (on the marketing site — this scares the target audience)
- "Algorithm" / "machine learning"
- "Optimize your relationship"
- "Strengthen your bond"
- "Communication skills"
- "Self-care" / "wellness"
- "Hubby" / "wifey" / "bae"
- "Game-changer" / "revolutionary"
- Any therapy/counseling framing

### Headline Formulas That Work for Our Audience

**Pain → Relief:**
- "Can't think of what to text her? We'll get you started."
- "You love her. Now help her feel it."

**Social proof / identity:**
- "For husbands who show love with actions, not words."
- "The app for guys who mean to text her but forget."

**Curiosity / specificity:**
- "What to text your wife at 2pm on a Tuesday."
- "The 3-word text that made her cry (in a good way)."

**Challenge / dare:**
- "Text her something real today. We'll help."
- "She's 6 feet away. When's the last time you told her?"

## Landing Page Copy Direction (v2)

### Hero

**Headline options (pick one):**
1. "You know what you feel. We help you say it." (benefit-forward)
2. "Can't think of what to text her? Start here." (pain-forward)
3. "Daily nudges to text your wife something real." (descriptive)

**Subheadline:**
"We send you a prompt. You fill in the blank. She gets a text from YOU — not a bot, not a template. Just you, saying what you actually feel."

**CTA:** "Try It Free — Your First Prompt in 60 Seconds"

### Problem Section

"You love her. You know you do. But somewhere between the kids, the commute, and the couch, 'thinking about her' stopped turning into 'texting her.' And now your message history looks like: grocery list, kid pickup times, 'on my way home.' Sound familiar?"

### How It Works

1. **We ask you a question.** Something like: "What did she do this week that made you smile?" Simple. Takes 10 seconds to think about.
2. **You fill in the blank.** We give you a starter: "I keep thinking about when you ___." You finish it with something real.
3. **She gets a text from you.** Copy it, paste it, send it from your number. It's your message. Because it IS your message.

### Objection Handling (FAQ)

**"Won't she know I'm using an app?"**
Nope. Because the message IS yours. We don't write it — you do. We just help you get started. It's like a friend saying "hey, text your wife and tell her about that thing."

**"Is this AI writing love notes for me?"**
No. We give you a prompt and a sentence starter. You fill in the real stuff — the inside jokes, the specific moments, the things only you know. AI can optionally help you polish it, but the content is 100% you.

**"I'm not a words person."**
Perfect. You're exactly who this is for. We don't need you to be poetic. We just need you to finish one sentence about your wife.

**"$5/month to text my wife?"**
$5/month for a daily reminder to be the husband she brags about. You spend more on coffee. Cancel anytime.

## SEO Quick Wins

The current landscape for "texts for wife" keywords is dominated by listicle sites (GoodHousekeeping, Marriage.com, Cosmopolitan, MomJunction, etc.) publishing massive lists of 100-250 copy-paste messages.

**Our angle to beat them:** Don't just list messages. For each message, explain:
- Why it works
- When to send it
- How to customize it for YOUR wife
- What makes it feel real vs. generic

This turns a commodity listicle into a genuinely useful guide, AND it naturally leads to our product. "Want this personalized for your wife every day? That's literally what we do."
